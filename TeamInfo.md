## Project Summary

This is a summary of the project!
Our project, flight freedomâ€™s goal is to provide the most in-depth, flight
delays and cancellations data customized to the users needs, with options
to filter based on origin and destinations, airlines, and times of the year.
There are several available platforms that can provide this data; however,
none of them offer useful filters to frequent fliers.
To many users, it is not enough to look at the average delay time for a
particular flight; our goal is to provide user with many filters such as
airlines, routes, and seasons as filters and have data presented in
different ways like graphs and charts. Users should be able to save their
favorite home locations and see information on flight delays and
cancellations for their home airport by logging in
